#MATH 
- like datetime there is a module called math too it has functions that helps us to perform mathematical operations which are as follows:

✅ Basic Operations

math.sqrt(x) → square root.

math.pow(x, y) → power (same as x**y).

math.factorial(x) → factorial of x.

math.fabs(x) → absolute value (always float).


✅ Rounding & Logs

math.ceil(x) → round up.

math.floor(x) → round down.

math.trunc(x) → truncate decimal part.

math.log(x) → natural log (base e).

math.log10(x) → log base 10.

math.log2(x) → log base 2.


✅ Trigonometry

math.sin(x), math.cos(x), math.tan(x) → trig functions (input in radians).

math.asin(x), math.acos(x), math.atan(x) → inverse trig functions.

math.degrees(x) → radians → degrees.

math.radians(x) → degrees → radians.


✅ Constants

math.pi → π (3.14159…).

- These are most used and asked one there are more too..but these are more important 

math.e → Euler’s number (~2.718).

math.inf → infinity.

math.nan → not-a-number.
