# TRY EXCEPT
The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.
The except block lets you handle the error.
The else block lets you execute code when there is no error.
The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks
EXAMPLE: 
try:
  print(x)
except NameError:
  print("Variable x is not defined")
except:
  print("Something else went wrong")

#FILE HANDLING 
The key function for working with files in Python is the open() function.
The open() function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.
Modes are : r for read error if dies not exist , a for append creates a file if dors not exist , w for write vreates s file if does not exist , x for creating throw error if cile already exist 
# Open the file "demofile.txt" and overwrite the content:
with open("demofile.txt", "w") as f:
  f.write("Woops! I have deleted the content!")
#open and read the file after the overwriting:
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  print(f.read())

# CREATING A FILE 
To create a new file in Python, use the open() method, with one of the following parameters:

"x" - Create - will create a file, returns an error if the file exists

"a" - Append - will create a file if the specified file does not exists

"w" - Write - will create a file if the specified file does not exists

Example
Create a new file called "myfile.txt":

f = open("myfile.txt", "x")

# DELETING A FILE 
import os.rmdir(foldername)
os.remove("demofile.txt")
- to remove folder 
use
