# Q1. What are Pythonâ€™s key features?
- Interpreted, dynamically typed, object-oriented.
- Easy to learn, large standard library.
- Cross-platform, supports multiple paradigms (OOP, functional, procedural).

# Q2. What are immutable and mutuable in python ?
- immutable can not be changed like int str float tuple
- mutuable can be changed like dict set list 

# Q3. What is difference between == and is ? 
- == compares values
- is check memory address
Example : list 1= [1,2,3]
          list 3 = list 1 // here list 3 in list 1 eill give true as they are pointing to same memory location 
          list 2 = [1,2,3] // here list 2 in list will not give true even if they hold same elements because memory location will be different 

# Q4. GIL? 
- global interpreter lock 
- only one thread can run Python code at a time makes multithreading slower 
- but in multi processing each code has its own interpretor can run in parallel
- a process is an independent program in execution with its own memory space, while a thread is a segment of a process that shares the process's memory and resources.

# Q5.
