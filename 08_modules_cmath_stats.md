#CMATH 
- kinda similar to maths but in this we can also handle complex numbers
- Almost has same functions like the one which are used in math can be used with cmath too
-  little bit functions differ
-  math has some functions not in cmath (like factorial, gcd).
- cmath has functions not in math (like phase(), polar(), rect()) → useful for complex numbers.

#STATISTICS 
- important module
- major statistics calculation is done using this module
- functions as follows :
statistics.harmonic_mean()	Calculates the harmonic mean (central location) of the given data
statistics.mean()	Calculates the mean (average) of the given data
statistics.median()	Calculates the median (middle value) of the given data
statistics.median_grouped()	Calculates the median of grouped continuous data
statistics.median_high()	Calculates the high median of the given data
statistics.median_low()	Calculates the low median of the given data
statistics.mode()	Calculates the mode (central tendency) of the given numeric or nominal data
statistics.pstdev()	Calculates the standard deviation from an entire population
statistics.stdev()	Calculates the standard deviation from a sample of data
statistics.pvariance()	Calculates the variance of an entire population
statistics.variance()	Calculates the variance from a sample of data
